  <p> The videos below are about a mission to stop scamming. Obviously there are quite a few Youtube channels out there today who focus on stopping scammers or preventing a scammer from scamming. But this website focuses around the three following Youtube channels. The video's below have been created by and shows the hard work of <strong>Mark Rober</strong>, <strong>Jim Browning</strong>, <strong>Trilogy Media</strong>, <em id = "JEFF">Messi, and Johnny?</em>. Your Probably wondering, Why these channels? or Only these three? But the answer is; these channels and others, <strong>I'm talking about the private investigators, Police, and all of the great people involved in this that I probably am missing from this paragraph.</strong> Not only are they electronicly trying to take down the scam centers. They are physically there putting their lives on the line by "going into the belly of the beast." Not just that but have also sucsessfully shut down a multitude of scam centers, granted that is because they were spotted in public, but that just shows how structured these scam centers are constructed. </p>

I will be adding more to the website as my knowlage of HTML, CSS, and JS grows. Also, when I watch the other videos with-in this group, I will adjust details accordingly. Heads up, I didn't think of this before, but in-order to leave a comment, etc. You'll need a Replit account. So if you already have one and are coding yourself <strong>FANTASTIC</strong> no need to worry! But for now those who don't, I will create a comment section to this webpage, once I figure out how.</p>

 <p>Mark Rober's video shown above; is about how he contributed to the operation, with his gadets and inventions. Along with a rundown of the operation and why these brave people decided to do this. And how <em>you</em> can help make a difference by educating everyone you know. From all of the previous videos Mark Rober has released, knowlage should be shared, so those that know how to use it for the better, can help the "world" grow and advance to become better.</p>

  <h3>Jim Browning's Video:</h3>

  <p>Gives an overview of what was happening and shows how it worked through the scammers security cameras and the glitter bombs <em>"built-in"</em> cameras. Jim Browning was able to hack into the scammers cammeras and also selective choose who he wanted to talk to by redirecting calls to himself, through their call system. Without Jim Browning, quite litterally, the mission would not have been possible. Without Jim Browning there would have been no way of knowing if they succeded or not or knowing whether there people inside were okay. </p>
