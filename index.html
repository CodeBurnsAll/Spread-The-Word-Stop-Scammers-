  <p> The videos below are about a mission to stop scamming. Obviously there are quite a few Youtube channels out there today who focus on stopping scammers or preventing a scammer from scamming. But this website focuses around the three following Youtube channels. The video's below have been created by and shows the hard work of <strong>Mark Rober</strong>, <strong>Jim Browning</strong>, <strong>Trilogy Media</strong>, <em id = "JEFF">Messi, and Johnny?</em>. Your Probably wondering, Why these channels? or Only these three? But the answer is; these channels and others, <strong>I'm talking about the private investigators, Police, and all of the great people involved in this that I probably am missing from this paragraph.</strong> Not only are they electronicly trying to take down the scam centers. They are physically there putting their lives on the line by "going into the belly of the beast." Not just that but have also sucsessfully shut down a multitude of scam centers, granted that is because they were spotted in public, but that just shows how structured these scam centers are constructed. </p>
